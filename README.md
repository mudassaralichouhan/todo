ToDo App
=
This code challenge assesses your skills in developing a simple API for a to-do list application. For this code challenge, you must use laravel and expose the API endpoints.

Please note that the code should be clean, commented and well-structured. We will test the endpoints using postman so you provide us with a postman collection with all the endpoints.

Creating the exact models needed for the application to work properly is completely up to you. You can opt to use `MySQL`, `MariaDB`, or `PostgreSQL` as your database.
